# Personalized-Student-Recommendations
A Python-based analysis tool that evaluates quiz performance from NEET Testline app, predicting valuable insights, personalized recommendations, and rank prediction of students.


# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project analyzes quiz performance data from the NEET Testline app to provide personalized student recommendations. By evaluating quiz responses, historical performance trends, and topic-wise accuracy, it generates insights to help students improve their preparation. Additionally, a probabilistic model predicts a student's estimated NEET rank based on past quiz performance and previous years' NEET results.

# FEATURES

1) Data Analysis: Extracts patterns in student performance, including weak areas, strengths, and improvement trends.

2) Personalized Recommendations: Suggests specific topics, question types, and difficulty levels for improvement.

3) Student Persona Analysis: Identifies learning styles, key strengths, and potential problem areas.

4) Rank Prediction Model: Uses historical performance and statistical modeling to estimate a studentâ€™s potential NEET rank.

# Approach

1. Data Analysis
Extract quiz responses, topic distributions, and difficulty levels.

2. Recommendations
Recommend according to the performance, suggestions are being povided.

4. Student Persona Profiling
Classify students into personas based on accuracy and consistency.
Example personas: "The Fast Learner" ,"The Careful Thinker"," "The Balanced Performer".

5. NEET Rank Prediction
A probabilistic model using quiz scores.
Predict estimated ranks based on quiz performance trends.
