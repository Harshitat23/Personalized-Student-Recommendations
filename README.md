# Personalized-Student-Recommendations
A Python-based analysis tool that evaluates quiz performance from NEET Testline app, predicting valuable insights, personalized recommendations, and rank prediction of students.


# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project analyzes quiz performance data from the NEET Testline app to provide personalized student recommendations. By evaluating quiz responses, historical performance trends, and topic-wise accuracy, it generates insights to help students improve their preparation. Additionally, a probabilistic model predicts a student's estimated NEET rank based on past quiz performance and previous years' NEET results.
